          <p className="text-lg">Charles Coffman writes character-driven science fiction with heart, humor, and a healthy dose of chaos. His debut novella, The Junk God Protocol, introduced readers to the crew of the Valiant, a mismatched family of salvagers tangled in mysteries far bigger than themselves. He followed it with Tidebound, a high-stakes story of betrayal, redemption, and sibling loyalty.</p>
          <p className="text-lg">Currently, Charles is hard at work on The Silence Between Stars, the next installment in the Valiant Salvage seriesâ€”a haunting tale of contagion, memory, and the quiet strength of found family.</p>
          <p className="text-lg">When he's not writing, Charles works as a software engineer, wrangles plot twists like bugs in code, and drinks too much coffee. He lives in Alabama with his family and a rotating cast of animals who may or may not be plotting against him.</p>
